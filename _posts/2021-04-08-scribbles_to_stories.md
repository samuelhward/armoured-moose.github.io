Writing is something I struggle with - I always have. When I was 10 I remember my Dad combing over the stories I'd written in preparation for exams. Again and again I would write contrived stories, and again we would break down the sentences I had strained to write.

Later on, when I was taking the last English exams and had spent most of class time drawing in my poetry book, I rushed to re-write my own essays on each of the poems I had drawn video game characters on. 

At college I remember writing essay responses to almost every open question my teacher asked at the end of each class. 5 minutes before my final exam I was anxiously waiting for feedback on my last essay. I finally bumped into my teacher who told me "yeah, it was alright."

As a child I remember my Dad sitting and reading over stories I'd churned



Interestingly, when i've often asked "how can I become CEO of X?" to various CEOs/leaders, writing skills creeps up again and again.

But writing is also something that most of us are pretty bad at. Admit it: do you know the difference between an em and en dash? How often do you - correctly - use semi-colons? 

Personally I can find writing a bit of a chore, but it's noticeably easier when I know what I want to say - and how I can say it.


Writing is something most of us struggle with.

Boiling down lots of information, possibly from a set of notes taken from a seminar, and turning that into a written piece.

Main steps:

1. [Gather the information](#gather-the-information)
2. [Identify the narrative](#identify-the-narrative)
3. [Re-organise according to the narrative](#re-organise-according-to-the-narrative)
4. [Connect the dots](#connect-the-dots)

## Gather the information

I think first and foremost is to assemble and consolidate as much relevant information as possible, from whichever source you're working from. I always find it helps to have everything available right in front of me - for example in one long text document. That way, I don't feel like I've missed anything, and I can look at everything in perspective.

## Identify the narrative

The next step is to take everything in front of you and ask yourself "what story is the information telling me?" After all, information is usually easier to digest in story form. 

A story should consist of clear sections, and it is _crucial_ that these flow naturally. Otherwise, the article will be hard to write, read and hard to take messages away from.

All this section takes is a single sentence per paragraph:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Hailing of East-asian response to covid in press

What fuels these bottom-up approaches? 

## Re-organise according to the narrative

The nice thing about nested bulleted lists is that, even during writing, it's easy to identify sections that might belong elsewhere and lift them out/move them. Forcing yourself to write down the ideas in a bulleted list often helps you to think about the narrative flow before you've even started writing, and saves you from endlessly going back to editing prose to make sure they flow - which breaks up your own flow.

## Connect the dots

A nice way to enforce this is to make the first sentence of each paragraph completely summarise the message of the paragraph. Repetition isn't bad, and when a reader subconsciously knows the type of information coming, they can focus on absorbing the specifics. 

Equally, the last sentence of a paragraph can also be used to link the next paragraph with what you're about to say - often by referring to the content of the two paragraphs directly.
