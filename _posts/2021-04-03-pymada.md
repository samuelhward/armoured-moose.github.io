A while ago, me and a friend of mine had the idea of implementing an AI that could beat us at Star Wars Armada. 

It's a turn-based (sequential) game of imperfect information. A back of the envelope calculation for a standard game gives a very large branching factor, and today it's impossible to solve by brute force.

The on-going code for the project is linked [here](https://github.com/armoured-moose/pymada/).


### Some ideas:

#### Multiple network types

Given the difference in logic associated with decisions in choosing targets, deciding how to defend, choosing move actions etc., it might make sense to have an AI player comprised of multiple networks which learn from the same training set. 



* start off by programming simple learning model to understand the gradient descent algorithm and its variations, could use example of navigating a ball through 2D plane to a target - equally how could we implement this using pymada?
* then could extend this example to learn TD lambda
