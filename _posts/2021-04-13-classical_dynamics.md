Could answer some questions I ask myself?


* what really is the Jacobian from an intuitive PoV? Jacobian matrix
* variational principle + self-adjoint operators 
    * a variational principle is essentially a statement that applies a variational constraint to a function e.g. that function must be minimised over some trajectory (like the total system energy along a particle trajectory)
    * solving catenary
    * Hermitian and hermitian transforms?

* Noether's theorem

* when is a theory 'Hamiltonian'?
* what is difference between 'Hamiltonian' and 'Lagrangian'? and when would we prefer each?

* what are canonical and non-canonical coordinates?
    * non-canonical means arbitrary coordinates.

* what is a Lie transform?

* adiabatic invariants (from a generalised point of view)

* poincare recurrence theorem
